# Devices, Accessories, & Augmentations

## Description:

A hardware toolkit to help you design products that give agency to the disabled community. Years ago, we started our inclusive design practice to try and identify and eliminate the mismatches that create barriers for the disabled. Along with that, FIT was another important concept. We didn't believe in the idea of one-size-fits-all, we were striving for one-size-fits-one. We were inspired by the fact that software is malleable and can take many forms. That means digital experiences can be tailored to fit individuals with disabilities. 

However, physical products are rarely fluid, they have form. With our inclusive design practices, we aspire to figure out how forms can be adjustable and augmented to meet individual needs. Because we believe everyone deserves great design, there needed to be a toolkit that designers could use to produce truly inclusive hardware. Devices have to support experiences that intertwine the digital and physical, therefore our approach to hardware is to create flexible systems through a lens of Devices + Accessories + Augmentations.
